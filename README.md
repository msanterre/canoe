Very simple URL shortener

Incredibly fast and simple URL shortener that runs on almost nothing.

It used Redis as a backend, so this will scale up to a considerable amount of URLs.

To set it up locally, you just need to follow this [guide](https://github.com/msanterre/canoe/wiki/Local-setup)

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/msanterre/canoe.git
```

### Usage

The best way to run this locally is to use fresh

```
go get github.com/pilu/fresh
```

Then go to the project root and run

```
fresh
```


### TODO
- [x] Provide dockerfile && docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Validation
- [ ] Pretty up README
- [x] Ensure slugs don't collide
- [ ] Stats
- [x] JSON support
